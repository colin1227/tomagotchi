## General Feedback

Colin, you did amazing for this project! I put comments inside your individual files to point out a few specific areas I would take into consideration, but other than that excellent work! Please see below for additional detailed feedback. Also, check out the comments I made in your .html .css and .js files.

## Glows
Nice work with your tamagotchi project Colin! What was very impressive with this project was how much work you put into adding css animations. I appreciate all of your hard work and persistence to learn and implement something new as quickly as possible.

These are excellent qualities and it shows that you take the user experience into account. So, again, excellent work!

## Grows
Again, you are demonstrating a lot of grow in such a short amount of time, Colin. So, you’re doing great!  Some things I might suggest to you that would help you grow even more would be to read as much documentation / code examples as you can when you have time. Also, continue to get comfortable searching for resources online. It’s very common for documentation to not make much sense when you’re reading it for the first time, but with practice and persistence, you will begin to recognize patterns / keywords that will help you better understand the documentation in due time.

## Code Quality
Colin, your code quality continues to improve tremendously over time, so keep up the momentum there. One thing I feel you could improve on the most is making sure to remove all commented out / non-functional code from the files in your master branch. You can still keep these blocks / snippets of code, but I would recommend putting them on a development branch for future implementation. This will bring your code bases up to industry standard and make your work more attractive / professional to potential employers. All in all, great work Colin.
